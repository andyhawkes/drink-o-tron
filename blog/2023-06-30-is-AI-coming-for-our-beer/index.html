        <h1>Is AI coming for our beer?</h1>

        <p>Apologies for the clickbait headline, but it's 2023 and the AI revolution is upon us (apparently), so what are you going to do?...</p>

        <p>Dislaimer: this blog post is actually more of a "wow, AI is actually quite clever and fun, but it's not going to replace humans just yet" kind of thing.</p>

        <p>Anyway, back to the point - I found myself wondering "how well would ChatGPT do at generating a name and a beer review for one of the random <a href="/beer">beer ideas</a> that this site can generate?"</p>

        <p>So here we go...</p>

        <p>First we need <a href="/beer/?a=0&b=9&c=25&d=50&e=144,60,150,199,171">a random beer</a>...</p>

        <span id="zeitgeistText">Gluten-free salted caramel american-style double india pale ale <span class="hops">Hops: Spalt, Cekin, Sun, Chinook &amp; Willamette</span></span>

        <p>OK, that's sufficiently weird and wonderful, so let's ask <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> for a name...</p>

        <p><kbd>Invent a name for a Gluten-free salted caramel american-style double india pale ale brewed with Spalt, Cekin, Sun, Chinook & Willamette hops</kbd></p>
        
        <p><samp>Caramel Hopsplash: A Gluten-Free Salty Temptation</samp></p>

        <p>OK - not too bad, as beer names go.<br/>
        How about a review?</p>

        <p><kbd>Write a short review of a Gluten-free salted caramel american-style double india pale ale brewed with Spalt, Cekin, Sun, Chinook & Willamette hops</kbd></p>

        <p><samp>The Gluten-Free Salted Caramel American-Style Double India Pale Ale is a unique and intriguing brew that pushes the boundaries of traditional beer flavors. This beer combines the popular American-style double IPA with the decadent notes of salted caramel, resulting in a rich and complex drinking experience.</samp></p>

        <p>OK, sounds plausible...</p>

        <p><samp>One notable feature of this beer is its gluten-free composition, which caters to those with gluten sensitivities or dietary restrictions. The fact that it manages to maintain its distinct flavors while being gluten-free is a commendable achievement. This makes it an excellent option for individuals looking to explore flavorful craft beers without compromising their dietary needs.</samp></p>

        <p>How very considerate!</p>
        
        <p><samp>Upon pouring, the beer showcases a beautiful amber hue with a slight haze, hinting at its hop-forward nature. The aroma is a delightful blend of hoppy goodness and sweet caramel notes. The combination of Spalt, Cekin, Sun, Chinook, and Willamette hops lends the brew a robust hop profile with hints of citrus, pine, and floral undertones.</samp></p>
        
        <p>I was hoping for "a delightful brew - hoppy, nutty, foamy, with a surprisingly fruity note which lingers on the tongue", but that's just because I like the movie "The World's End"...</p>

        <p><samp>The taste is where this beer truly shines. The initial sip reveals a burst of hop bitterness that quickly gives way to the sweetness of salted caramel. The caramel flavor is well-balanced, providing a luscious and indulgent quality without overpowering the hoppy character. The use of salted caramel adds a layer of complexity, enhancing the overall flavor profile and creating a harmonious interplay between the hops and sweetness.</samp></p>
        
        <p>OK, still worryingly plausible...</p>

        <p><samp>The mouthfeel is smooth and full-bodied, typical of a double IPA, with a moderate carbonation level that complements the beer's flavors. The finish is pleasantly bitter, leaving a lingering hoppy aftertaste with a subtle touch of caramel sweetness.</samp></p>

        <p>And at the end of the day, who doesn't love a bit of moderate carbonation?!?</p>
        
        <p><samp>Overall, the Gluten-Free Salted Caramel American-Style Double India Pale Ale is a unique and enjoyable beer that successfully combines the best of both worldsâ€”bold hoppy notes and the indulgent richness of salted caramel. Its gluten-free composition is a commendable feature, broadening its appeal to a wider audience. If you're a fan of hop-forward beers with a twist of sweetness, this brew is certainly worth a try.</samp></p>

        <p>So there you go - a quite reasonable-sounding review of a randomly made-up beer created by a chat bot built on top of a large language model.</p>

        <p>OK, so maybe AI <em>is</em> going to steal our jobs, but not quite yet, and at least it can't drink our beer for us!</p>

        <p>Maybe I should contemplate paying for access to the ChatGPT API and have it create a review for every random beer idea that this site generates. What do you think?</p>
